# philosophyHQ

By: Maxim Grigg

Live-Link: https://philosophyq.herokuapp.com/

PhilosophyHq is a full stack application using PSQL, Express.js in the backend, and React.js in the frontend.
The application allows useres to interact with famous philosphers, dead and alive, by reading tweets, reading tweet replys, as well as
creating, editing, and deleting tweets and replies.

On the FrontEnd:
React:
React was used to handle all frontend logic and design.

Redux:
Redux is used to handle all state management by use of actions and thunks making API calls to the backend for data from the server.

CSS:
All styling was done with the use of vanilla CSS.

On the Backend:
Express.js:
Express.js was used to make the API's and connect the data base to the front end for a smooth user experience.

PostgresSQL:
PostgresSQL was the database used to build seeder files and easily manage database constarinsts and customization.

Sequelize:
All table management and data was managed with the use of sequelize.

Next Steps:
While I am happy with the overall design and feel of PhilosophyHQm I plan to implement more features going forward. I plan to implement
likes, follows, search, and users pages. As well as possibly creating an ecommerce portion for the philosphers to sell their favorite books.



Conclusion:
I hope you have enjoyed this application as much as I enjoyed making it. If you have any questions or would like to chat, please reach out to me on github or
